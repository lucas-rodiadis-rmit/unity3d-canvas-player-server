# Canvas Unity 3D Player Backend Server Application
This application is to be used in conjunction with the [Canvas Unity 3D Player Frontend Application](https://github.com/lucas-rodiadis-rmit/unity3d-canvas-player-client). This backend application alongside the frontend application can create a system that can work as an LTI 1.1 compliant external app that can be used in Canvas to embed WebGL Unity3D Builds. 

It is built using Express.js and Vite, using primarily TypeScript. 
The database for stored Unity WebGL Builds uses SQLite and has a migrations system in place.
